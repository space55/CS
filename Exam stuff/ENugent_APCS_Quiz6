1. What is the formal structure or signature of a class? Give an example
    Instance Variables - private int z;
    Constructor        - public Student() {}
    Methods            - public int getScore() {}

2. Explain the three characteristics of an object
    Behavior - How the object acts with data
    Data     - Things the class has stored
    Name     - Self explanatory

3. What is the benefit of "garbage collection"?
    It allows for less memory to be used by the program, in turn allowing for a program being able to run on more computers, and require less resources to run

4. Why would some variables be declared as private and others as public?
    Private variables allow for hidden data that other classes can't see, and/or to be used as local storage
    Public variables allow for other classes to access and change that variable (unless it's final)

5. What is a method signature? Give an example.
    A method signature is the visibility, return type, name, and parameters of a method
    i.e. protected static Student getStudent(String name)

6. What is the difference between a default constructor and a regular constructor?
    Default constructors initialize variables to 0 or null
    Regular constructors allow you to do your own stuff

7. What is the difference between a mutator method and an accessor method?
    A mutator method (setter) allows for someone to change data in the object
    An accessor method (getter) allows for someone to get data from the object

8. Explain the difference between primitive type variables and reference types. Give an example of each
    Primitive are usually numbers or chars (int num = 0; char a = 65)
    Reference variables are usually pointers to other locations in memory, i.e. objects (Thread t = new Thread(ThisThreadProgramWillCrashThisComputer))

9. What is the difference between a for loop and a while loop?
    A for loop allows you to initialize a variable, define the conditions under which the loop will run, and what to do once the loop has finished an iteration
    A while loop only allows you to set conditions under which the loop will run

10. What does it mean to instantiate or create an object?
    It means that you allocate a space in memory for an object to live, and allow other parts of your program to use methods from that object

11. How would you create a new Student object named stu?
    Student stu = new Student();

12. Explain the following functions in the Student class. What type of method it is, what its return type, and what are the parameters
    void setName(aString) - Returns nothing, asks for a String, and sets name to that String
    String getName() - Returns the name of the Student, and asks for no parameters
    void setScore(int whichTest, testScore) - Returns nothing, and sets test whichTest's (a parameter) score to testScore (another parameter, both of type int)
    int getScore(whichTest) - Returns an int, the score of test whichTest (a parameter of type int)
    int getAverage() - Returns the average of all test scores
    int getHighScore() - Returns the highest score of all tests, and asks for no parameters
    String toString() - Returns object's data in String format, and asks for no parameters
